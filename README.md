**_sTudoo is a webapp written in python which helps students to organize their class related projects, keep the overview and stay on track with deadlines._**

## The Problem
- One of the stressful parts of being a student is to stay organized with all the deliveries and deadlines for specific classes at the university.
- Wouldn't it be great to have an overview of all your current classes, their related projects and deadlines?

## The Solution
- sTudoo allows you to add classes (aka goals) to your account.
- Because many courses contain several exams, it is possible to map them as projects under your classes. A start and deadline date can be additionally added.
- In each project it is possible to create the relevant tasks to make progress and stay on track. You can set priorities ( i.e. A, B, C) and context tags (i.e. #home, #uni, #laptop)
