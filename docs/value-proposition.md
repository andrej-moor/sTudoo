# The Team

Our team name for this project is **_The Happy Students_**. Why? Well, we're both students and try to code a web app which should help to reduce the stress in our student lives.

The idea to create **[sTudoo](https://github.com/andrej-moor/sTudoo.git)** grew as a project in our web development with Pyhton class at the [Business School of Economics & Law](https://www.hwr-berlin.de/en/) in Berlin, Germany.

Beside the app itself, the documentation is a part of our exam in this class, so don't be confused if the Docs read a little weird compared to a *regular* doc.
