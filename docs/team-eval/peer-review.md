# Peer Review

## Andreas Moor -> Jana

### My Observation

My observation was that me an Jana worked quite harmoniously. We could split the work load into Backend (mostly Jana's part) and Frontend & Ops (mostly Andy's part). We were both commited to keep the communication flowing, which meant to talk about what works, does pnot work, what should be addapted and what would be out of the scope of the project and also out of our current capability to manage, with all the other projects that had to be pushed paralelly to.

### Effect On Me

I realy appriciated the honest and clear communication and Jana's drive to get things done even under heavy load. Which was honestly a help in my own motivation. Jana was really one of the less project members at university that I would wish to have in real life in the professional context.

### Tip For The Future

I hope that Jana will stick to here values and her powerful mentality, here humor and her gentle and polite way to communicate. And maybe I'm lucky enough to work on a different project with her again.
