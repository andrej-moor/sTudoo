## [Jana Kusch] - review 1

### My observation (Wahrnehmung)

Some of the required features and implementations seemed quite advanced, especially regarding the database. Since I was already knowledgeable in SQL and table operations, it did not concern me that much but many of my co-students seemed to have quite a bit of trouble. 


### Effect on me (Wirkung)

I found it a good challenge to have a new programming subject to do research on but found it all in all a bit too much work for only 5 course credits. 

### Tip for the future (Wunsch)

More help concerning the documentation of projects and more relevant code in class, since the code we learned only superficially helped for the actual web development and especially for our project I had to look up several relevant materials.
