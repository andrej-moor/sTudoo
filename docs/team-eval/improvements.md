# How we would improve next time

Since sTudoo was our first full-stack web application we both coded as a team, there have been several **chalenges** that can be solved easily with the following **improvements**.

## 1. Merge Confilcts
One of the unneccassery and time consuming anoyances are merge conflict and the _fun_ of resolving them.
## Problem
The main reasons for having those where:
- a missing `.gitignore` file,
- the lacking of modularity of the application and
- the lack of the usage of `Branches`.

### How we would improve
- Create a .gitignore file that excludes files that like cashe, the created database etc. which lead to merge conflicts
- Invest more time in the planing process of importable applications modules. Thinking in features of functions to make easier to code without having merge conflicts.
- Commit to use Git braches to work on features and make _clean_ merges possible.

## Unfinished app features

The estimation of the time needed to code specific functionalities that one hasn't code before is a definetly a challange that is known in project management.

### Problem

That is why we overestimated what features we were able to finish.

### How we would improve

The main improvement would probably be to learn from experience, which isn't a direct action that one could count on in the next project, but more a type of mental flexibility to accept that experience grows over time and the possibility to estimate the needed time budget will come with the time spend coding specific features.
