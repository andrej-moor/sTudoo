# How we would improve next time

Since sTudoo was our first full-stack web application which we both coded as a team, there have been several **chalenges** that can be solved easily with the following **improvements**.

## 1. Merge Confilcts
One of the unneccassery and time consuming annoyances were merge conflicts and the _'fun'_ of resolving them.
## Problem
The main reasons for having those were:
- a missing `.gitignore` file,
- the lacking of modularity of the application and
- the lack of the usage of `Branches`.

### How we would improve
- Create a .gitignore file that excludes files like cache, the created database etc. which lead to merge conflicts
- Invest more time in the planing process of importable applications modules. Thinking in features of functions that make it easier to code without having merge conflicts.
- Commiting to use Git braches to work on features to make _clean_ merges possible.

## Unfinished app features

The estimation of the time needed to code specific functionalities that one hasn't code before is a definitely a challange that is known in project management.

### Problem

The main issue was the overestimation of the ammount of features that we were able to finish in the time frame that has been provided and the tech stack and it's technologies that had to be mastered.

### How we would improve

The main improvement would probably to learn from experience, which isn't a direct action plan that one could count on in the next project, but more a type of mental flexibility to accept that experience grows over time and the possibility to estimate the needed time budget will come with the time spend coding specific features under the usage of the tech stack that is known and mastered.
