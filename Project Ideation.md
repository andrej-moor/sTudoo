# Project Ideation 
Below you can find the project idea of the webapp "Visudoo" created by the team "The Unicorns".
## Team Name
-> "The Unicorns"
## Contributors 
- Jana Kusch
- Andreas Moor
## Value Proposition of the app
- Visudoo is a web app written in Phython that helps you achieve the life you want.
- The principle is that we first visually imagine what we want in order to achieve it. If what we imagine is attractive enough, imagining it attracts ideas on how to realize it.
- For this, the app uses a grid overview for your BIG GOALS in a form of a digital vision board.
1. You can create your goals and add text and picture.
2. You can break down your goals into specific projects that will ensure the achievement of your goals.
3. You can break down your projects into feasible steps to complete them.
- If you want, you can be visually reminded of your big goals by a short slides show before you dedicate yourself to your tasks.
- Stay on track and reach your goals faster because you don't let them out of your sight.
- YOUR vision board, YOUR projects, YOUR daily tasks!
